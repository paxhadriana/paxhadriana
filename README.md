# Introduction
Hello! I'm Hadrian and I like to solve problems. 

French-Vietnamese, living in France (CET). 

I work in data management, mostly through Excel.

# Projects
Projects are currently small-scale scripts that aim to automate or otherwise improve data management processes, perform basic ETL and prepare the data for analysis. I'm leaving them on a [public repo](https://github.com/paxhadriana/Data-Tools) in case they may come in handy for others facing similar issues and as a way to motivate myself to keep working on them.
