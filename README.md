# Introduction
Hello! I'm Hadrian and I like to solve problems. 

French-Vietnamese, currently in France (CET). 

I work in data management, mostly through Excel and some SQL.

## Current Projects
I am currently working on small-scale scripts that aim to automate or otherwise improve data management processes, perform basic ETL and prepare the data for analysis. 

I am leaving them on a [public repo](https://github.com/paxhadriana/Data-Tools) in hopes they may come in handy as a base/reference for others facing similar issues and as a way to motivate myself to get them to a more polished state as I improve my Python skills.
