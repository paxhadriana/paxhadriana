# Introduction
Hello! I'm Hadrian and I like to solve problems. 

French-Vietnamese, living in France (CET). 

I work in data management, mostly through Excel.

# Projects
Projects are currently small-scale scripts that aim to automate or otherwise improve data management processes, perform basic ETL and prepare the data for analysis.
